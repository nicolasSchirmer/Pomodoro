# Pomodoro

An open source app that let you be more organized with your time.



Accordingly to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). The **Pomodoro Technique** is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are named **\*pomodoros***, the plural in English of the Italian word *pomodoro* (tomato), after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.
